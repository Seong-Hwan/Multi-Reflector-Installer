# Multi-Reflector-Installer (Proof of Concept)
The script is very much currently a proof of concept and gets you about 90% of the way to have everything fully installed and configured. The concept is, This will build you a 3 mode Ham radio digital voice reflector server that will transcode Yaesu Fusion, DMR, and D-Star with the help of AMBED and AMBE vocoder chips. I did not build each application. This script simply goes through the install steps for each application for you and configures apache for the dashboards. Features and abilities coming...

#### This script will install the following:
  - XLXD *(D-Star/DMR Reflector that also communicates with AMBED)*
  - YSFReflector *(HomeBrew Fusion Reflector)*
  - YSF2DMR *(The bridge software between YSF and XLX)*
  - YSF and XLX Dashboards *(Web page that shows real-time activity)*
  - Apache2 and configure the virtualhosts for both dashboards
  
  **But not**
 - AMBED (along with the required AMBE chips)
 - *AMBED can be installed locally or on a remote server, but is required for the transcoding part.* 
  
#### You will need the following information to get started:
 - Ready to go **and updated** fresh install of Debian 9.x
 - FQDN for ysf and xlx
 - XLX number that isnt taken (or pick a random one for testing)
 
#### The script does not yet configure the ini or config files which you will have to do:
 - ysf2dmr.ini
 - ysfreflector.ini
 - xlxd config.inc.php & init.d file
 
#### To give you a visual idea of what the end result would look like, here are 2 scenarios..

## Scenario A :
Cloud Server installation allowing for worldwide connectivity. Here is XLX410 as an example..

## Scenario B :
A single tower site installation allowing local communication across 3 different digital modesâ€¦
