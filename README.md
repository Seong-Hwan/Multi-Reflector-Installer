# Multi-Reflector-Installer (Proof of Concept)
The script is very much currently a proof of concept and gets you about 90% of the way to have everything fully installed and configured. The concept is, This will build you a 3 mode ham radio digital voice reflector server that will transcode Yaesu Fusion, DMR, and D-Star with the help of AMBED and AMBE vocoder chips. I did not build each application. This script simply goes through the install steps for each application for you and configures apache for the dashboards. Features and abilities coming...

#### This script will install the following:
  - `XLXD` *(D-Star/DMR Reflector that also communicates with AMBED)*
  - `YSFReflector` *(HomeBrew Fusion Reflector)*
  - `YSF2DMR` *(The bridge software between YSF and XLX)*
  - `YSF and XLX Dashboards` *(Web pages that shows real-time activity)*
  - Apache2 and configure the virtualhosts for both dashboards
  
  **But not**
 - `AMBED` (along with the required AMBE chips)
 - *AMBED can be installed locally or on a remote server, but is required for the transcoding part.* 
  
#### You will need the following information to get started:
 - Ready to go **and updated** fresh install of Debian 9.x
 - FQDN for ysf and xlx web dashboards
 - XLX number that isnt taken (or pick a random one for testing)


#### The script does not yet edit all the config files in order to complete the installation:
| App | Config file(s) |
| ------ | ------ |
| XLXD | /etc/init.d/xlxd, /var/www/xlxd/pgs/config.inc.php |
| YSF | /ysfreflector/YSFReflector.ini |
| YSF2DMR | /ysf2dmr/YSF2DMR.ini |

### Using the Multi-Reflector-Installer script:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/n5amd/Multi-Reflector-Installer.git
cd Multi-Reflector-Installer
./Multi-Reflector-Installer.sh
```

### To manage each service after installation:
 **XLXD** 
 ```sh
 systemctl start|stop|status|restart xlxd
 ```
  - Installs to /xlxd
  - Logs are in /var/log/messages
  - Be sure to restart xlxd after each config change

 
 **YSFReflector**
  ```sh
 systemctl start|stop|status|restart ysfreflector
 ```
  - Installs to /ysfreflector
  - Logs are in /var/log/YSFReflector
 
 **YSF2DMR**
 
 I havent been able to make a working Systemd unit file for this yet. So this app will simply have to run in screen.
 ```sh
 screen -S ysf2dmr
 cd /ysf2dmr
 ./YSF2DMR YSF2DMR.ini
 ```
 
  To exit the screen session and leave ysf2dmr running:
  ```sh
  ctrl-a, then press d
  ```
To return to the screen session:
```sh
screen -r ysf2dmr
```
 
 ### Linking to AMBED for transcoding:
 1. Install AMBED: https://github.com/n5amd/ambed-debian-installer
 2. Edit the /etc/init.d file for xlxd.
 ```sh
 nano or vi /etc/init.d/xlxd
 ```
 Edit the ARGUMENTS line:
 ```sh
 ARGUMENTS="XLX### <YOUR IP> <IP OF AMBED>" #Use 127.0.0.1 if ambed is on the same computer as XLXD
 EX: ARGUMENTS="XLX111 192.168.0.2 127.0.0.1"
 ```
 Then update systemd to read the updated init file and restart xlxd:
 ```sh
 systemctl daemon-reload
 systemctl restart xlxd
 ```

#### To give you a visual idea of what the end result would look like, here are 2 scenarios..

## Scenario A :
Cloud Server installation allowing for worldwide connectivity like a typical reflector. Here is XLX410 as an example..

## Scenario B :
A single tower site installation allowing local communication across 3 different digital modesâ€¦
